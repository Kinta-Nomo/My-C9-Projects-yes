We, banana the third of the great empire of the Bamerica, Decided to use up a system known as Banner Ban Baster which causes a harmfull gas for us. In order to pass through our country laws, they are compalsury to not to bring a Baster indeed. As the result of our new law, We might use few days per bananians and vegitarians from Banada, Banan, Banifornia, Boston, Bania and Banussia. In order to create this law, we, Bamerican Bamericans were supposed to get rid of the fifth law, "V:In order to change the law, must not supposed to include unordered community" which took 75 bears of consideration into law of Bamerica. Nowdays the Bouth Borea is having a trouble with their laws. And we mustn't follow up on them, anyway possible. As mensioned, we will not expect your in-convinienceness even though you are Bamerican Bananians. Our new law "V.Bananians' Banner Ban Baster requirements" will be set bermenently into Bamerica from late 2019, Baugust 20, 0 am.
